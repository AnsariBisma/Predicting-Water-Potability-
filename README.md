Predicting Water Potability Using Machine Learning

Analyzing open-source water quality data to classify whether water is potable (safe for drinking) based on physicochemical features. 
The workflow includes data ingestion, cleaning, feature engineering, model training and evaluation, and presentation of results through reports and visualizations to aid in public health insights.

dataset : Contains 3,276 instances with 10 features including pH, Hardness, Solids, Chloramines, Sulfate, Conductivity, Organic Carbon, Trihalomethanes, Turbidity, and a binary label Potability.
